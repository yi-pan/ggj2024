cry_kid:Sorry, could you please press the 6th floor for me? I could not reach it!
*No one helps the kid. They all want to get to the top floor first.*
character:...<<Why do I want to help this kid?...>>
*Tears started streaming from the kid's eyes, they looked really upset and began to cry loudly*
cry_kid:Plzâ€¦
*I step forward to press the 6th floor, but the others put their hands on the panel to stop me.*
character:<<Seems like I need to get rid of their hands first before pressing the button.>>
