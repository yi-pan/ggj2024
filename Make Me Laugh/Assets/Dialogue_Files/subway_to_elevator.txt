character:Can you believe it? I just ran into that kid again on the subway
character:the one who was crying loudly on the plane
friend:Hahahahah, I hope he didn't run into any trouble this time
character:He didn't run into any trouble...
friend:But?
character:But it seems like the subway was too boring for a little kid; he was looking for some fun
character:So, I played some weird music on the instrument... um... and then scared off the other passengers... That was really a bit awkward.
friend:Hahaha, sounds like you guys would make great playmates!
friend:But seriously, why did you do so much for that kid?
character:I'm not really sure myself…
character:Maybe it's because I also hated taking trains when I was little
character:but back then, I just stared blankly at the scenery passing by outside the window
character:You're right, the younger me could have probably been a great playmate for this kid…
