character:Can you believe it? I just ran into that kid again on the subway
character:the one who was crying loudly on the plane
friend:Hahahahah, I hope they didn't run into any trouble this time
character:He didn't run into any trouble...
friend:But?
character:But it seems like the subway was too boring for a little kid; they were looking for some fun
friend:I agree, comuting is boring
character:Maybe? I then played some weird music... um...
character:and then scared off the other passengers...
character:That was really a bit awkward.
friend:Hahaha, sounds like you two would make great playmates!
friend:But seriously, why did you do so much for that kid?
character:I'm not really sure myself…
character:Maybe it's because I also hated taking trains alone when I was little
character:but back then, I completely shutdown my feelings.
friend:to not cause any trouble for your parents?
character:the younger me could have probably been a great playmate for this kid…
character:Haha, You're right
friend:There is no need to be only "younger self", my friend
character:Getting on the elevator, no signal for a while~
