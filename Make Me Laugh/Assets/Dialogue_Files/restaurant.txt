character:Just now, in the elevator...
friend:Did you run into that kid again?
character:Yeah, it feels like I keep bumping into them everywhere today
friend:Maybe it's not just simply a kid...
friend:I guess that kid cried again. What happened this time?
character:The kid was too short to reach the floor they wanted to go to,
character:and people tried to stop me from helping lol
friend:Wow, they really wanna go to work haha
character:Hahahahaha, true. So, I hit them... on their hands.
friend:What! Did you really do that?
character:Yes, it kinda felt like a little bit of revenge
character:to the indifferent adult in my childhood...
friend:“A little bit of revenge,“ that's an interesting way to put it…
friend:Are you sure that kid is actually real?
character:I don't know anymore
character:But they saved my day, I am glad to laugh together.
friend:And hopefully your noodle taste good!
